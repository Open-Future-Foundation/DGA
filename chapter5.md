## CHAPTER V COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AND PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS

### Article 23 Requirements relating to competent authorities

(1) The competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 12 and Article 20 shall be legally distinct from, and functionally independent of any provider of data intermediation services or entity included in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations. The functions of the competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 12 and Article 20 may be performed by the same entity. Member States may either establish one or more new entities or rely on existing ones.

(2) Competent authorities shall exercise their tasks in an impartial, transparent, consistent, reliable and timely manner.

(3) The top-management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the relevant tasks of the competent authorities cannot be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of the services which they evaluate, nor the authorised representative of any of those parties or represent them. This shall not preclude the use of evaluated services that are necessary for the operations of a competent authority or the use of such services for personal purposes.

(4) Top-management and personnel of the competent authorities shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgment or integrity in relation to evaluation activities entrusted to them.

(5) The competent authorities shall have at their disposal the adequate financial and human resources to carry out the tasks assigned to them, including the necessary technical knowledge and resources.

(6) The competent authorities of a Member State shall provide the Commission and competent authorities from other Member States, on reasoned request and without undue delay, with the information necessary to carry out their tasks under this Regulation. Where a national competent authority considers the information requested to be confidential in accordance with Union and national rules on commercial and professional confidentiality, the Commission and any other competent authorities concerned shall ensure such confidentiality.

### Article 24 Right to lodge a complaint

(1) Any affected natural and legal persons shall have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant national competent authority against a provider of data intermediation services or an entity entered in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations in relation to any matter falling within the scope of this Regulation.

(2) The competent authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the progress of the proceedings and of the decision taken, and shall inform the complainant of the remedies provided for in Article 25.

### Article 25 Right to an effective judicial remedy

(1) Notwithstanding any administrative or other non-judicial remedies, any affected natural and legal persons shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy with regard to:

(a) legally binding decisions of the competent authorities referred to in Articles 13, 17 and 21 taken in the management, control and enforcement of the notification regime for providers of data intermediation services and the monitoring of entities entered into a national register of recognised data altruism organisations.

(2) Proceedings pursuant to this Article shall be brought before the courts of the Member State of the competent authority against which the judicial remedy is sought individually or, where relevant, by the representatives of one or more natural or legal persons.

(3) When a competent authority fails to act on a complaint, any affected natural and legal persons shall either have the right to effective judicial remedy or access to review by an impartial body with the appropriate expertise..
