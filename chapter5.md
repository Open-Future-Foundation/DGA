## CHAPTER V COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AND PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS

### Article 23 Requirements relating to competent authorities

(1) The competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 12 and Article 20 shall be legally distinct from, and functionally independent of any provider of data sharing services or entity included in the register of recognised data altruism organisations.

(2) Competent authorities shall exercise their tasks in an impartial, transparent, consistent, reliable and timely manner.

(3) The top-management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the relevant tasks of the competent authority provided for in this Regulation cannot be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of the services which they evaluate, nor the authorised representative of any of those parties or represent them. This shall not preclude the use of evaluated services that are necessary for the operations of the competent authority or the use of such services for personal purposes.

(4) Top-management and personnel shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgment or integrity in relation to evaluation activities entrusted to them.

(5) The competent authorities shall have at their disposal the adequate financial and human resources to carry out the tasks assigned to them, including the necessary technical knowledge and resources.

(6) The competent authorities of a Member State shall provide the Commission and competent authorities from other Member States, on reasoned request, with the information necessary to carry out their tasks under this Regulation. Where a national competent authority considers the information requested to be confidential in accordance with Union and national rules on commercial and professional confidentiality, the Commission and any other competent authorities concerned shall ensure such confidentiality.
