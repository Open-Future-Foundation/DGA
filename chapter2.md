## CHAPTER II RE-USE OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PROTECTED DATA HELD BY PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES

### Article 3 Categories of data

(1) This Chapter applies to data held by public sector bodies which are protected on grounds of:

(a) commercial confidentiality including business, professional and company secrets;

(b) statistical confidentiality;

(c) protection of intellectual property rights of third parties; or

(d) protection of personal data, insofar as such data fall outside the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/1024.

(2) This Chapter does not apply to:

(a) data held by public undertakings;

(b) data held by public service broadcasters and their subsidiaries, and by other bodies or their subsidiaries for the fulfilment of a public service broadcasting remit;

(c) data held by cultural establishments and educational establishments;

(d)  data held by public sector bodies which are protected for reasons of national security , defence or public security; or

(e)  data the supply of which is an activity falling outside the scope of the public task of the public sector bodies concerned as defined by law or by other binding rules in the Member State concerned, or, in the absence of such rules, as defined in accordance with common administrative practice in that Member State, provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review.

(3) This Chapter does not create any obligation on public sector bodies to allow re-use of data nor does it release public sector bodies from their confidentiality obligations under Union or national law. This Chapter is without prejudice to Union and national law or international agreements to which the Union or Member States are parties on the protection of categories of data provided in paragraph 1. This Chapter is without prejudice to Union and national law on access to documents.

### Article 4 Prohibition of exclusive arrangements

(1) Agreements or other practices pertaining to the re-use of data held by public sector bodies containing categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) which grant exclusive rights or which have as their object or effect to grant such exclusive rights or to restrict the availability of data for re-use by entities other than the parties to such agreements or other practices shall be prohibited.

(2) By way of derogation from paragraph 1, an exclusive right to re-use data referred to in that paragraph may be granted to the extent necessary for the provision of a service or the supply of a product in the general interest that would otherwise not be possible.

(3) An exclusive right according to paragraph 2 shall be granted in compliance with the principles of transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination.

(5) The period of exclusivity of the right to re-use data shall not exceed three years. Where a contract is concluded, the duration of the contract awarded shall be as aligned with the period of exclusivity.

(6) The award of an exclusive right pursuant to paragraphs (2) to (5), including the reasons why it is necessary to grant such a right, shall be transparent and be made publicly available online, where relevant, in a form that is in accordance with Union law on public procurement.

(7) Agreements or other practices falling within the scope of the prohibition in paragraph 1, which do not meet the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, and which were concluded before the date of entry into force of this Regulation shall be terminated at the end of the contract and in any event at the latest within three years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.

### Article 5 Conditions for re-use

(1) Public sector bodies which are competent under national law to grant or refuse access for the re-use of one or more of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) shall make publicly available the conditions for allowing such re-use. In that task, they may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1).

(2) Conditions for re-use shall be non-discriminatory, proportionate and objectively justified with regard to categories of data and purposes of re-use and the nature of the data for which re-use is allowed. These conditions shall not be used to restrict competition.

(3) Public sector bodies shall, in accordance with Union and national law, impose the conditions necessary for preserving the protected nature of the data and taking into account the risks related to its processing. Such conditions may, inter alia, consist of the following:

(a) to access and re-use data that the public sector body or the competent body upon the request of the re-user anonymizes or pseudonymises in the case of personal data, or delete modifies, aggregates, or treats by any other method of disclosure control in the case of commercially confidential information, and confidential statistical data, or content protected by intellectual property rights;

(b) to access and re-use the data remotely within a secure processing environment provided and controlled by the public sector; or

(c)  to access and re-use the data within the physical premises in which the secure processing environment is located, if remote access cannot be allowed without jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.

(5) In the case of re-use allowed according to paragraph 3 points (b) and (c) the public sector bodies shall impose conditions that preserve the integrity of the functioning of the technical systems of the secure processing environment used. The public sector body shall reserve the right to verify the process, the means and any results of processing of data undertaken by the re-user to preserve the integrity of the protection of the data and reserve the right to prohibit the use of results that contain information jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.

(5a) Unless national law includes specific safeguards on applicable confidentiality obligations relating to the re-use of data covered in Article 3(1), the public sector body shall make the use of data provided in accordance with paragraph 3 conditional on the adherence by the re-user to a confidentiality obligation that prohibits the disclosure of any information that jeopardises the rights and interests of third parties that the re-user may have acquired despite the safeguards put in place. Re-users shall be prohibited from re-identifying any data subject to whom the data relates and shall be required to assess on an on-going basis the risks of re-identification and to notify any data breach resulting in the re-identification of the data subjects concerned to the public sector body. The re-user shall without undue delay, where appropriate with the assistance of the public sector body, inform the legal persons whose rights may be affected in case an unauthorised re-use of non-personal data occurs.

(6) Where the re-use of data cannot be granted in accordance with the obligations laid down in paragraphs 3 to 5 and there is no legal basis for transmitting the data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the public sector body may, insofar as allowed by Union and national law, provide assistance to potential re-users in seeking consent of the data subjects and permission from the data holders whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use, where it is feasible without disproportionate burden for the public sector body. In that task it may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1).

(7) Re-use of data shall only be allowed in compliance with intellectual property rights. The right of the maker of a database as provided for in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC shall not be exercised by public sector bodies in order to prevent the re-use of data or to restrict re-use beyond the limits set by this Regulation.

(8) When data requested, or part thereof, is considered to be confidential information under Article 3 (1) (a) and (b), in accordance with Union or national law on commercial or statistical confidentiality, the re-use of such data shall only be allowed in case the confidential information is not disclosed as a result of allowing such re-use, unless such re-use is allowed in accordance with paragraph (6).

(8a) Where a re-user intends to transfer non-personal data protected on the grounds set out in Article 3(1) to a third country, it shall inform the public sector body of its intention as well as of the purpose of the transfer at the time of requesting the re-use. In the case of re-use in accordance with paragraph 6, the re-user shall, where appropriate with the assistance of the public sector body, inform the legal person whose rights and interests may be affected of that intention, purpose and the appropriate safeguards, and the public sector body shall not allow the re-use unless the legal person gives the permission for the transfer.

(10) The re-user shall not transfer non-personal data protected on grounds set out in Article 3 to a third country other than a country designated in accordance with paragraph 10a unless the re-user undertakes: 

(a) to comply with the obligations imposed in accordance with paragraphs 7 and 8 even after the data is transferred to the third country; and 

(b)  to accept the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State of the public sector body as regards any dispute related to the compliance with the obligation in point a).

(10aa) In order to support public sector bodies and re-users, the Commission may adopt implementing acts providing model contractual clauses for complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph (10) points (a) and (b). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(3).

(10a) When justified by a substantial number of requests across the Union concerning the re-use of non-personal data in specific third countries, the Commission may adopt implementing acts declaring that the legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements of a third country:

(a) ensure protection of intellectual property and trade secrets in a way that is essentially equivalent to the protection ensured under Union law;

(b) are being effectively applied and enforced; and

(c) provide effective judicial redress.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29.

(11) Specific Union acts adopted in accordance with a legislative procedure may deem certain non-personal data categories held by public sector bodies to be highly sensitive for the purposes of this Article, where their transfer to third countries may put at risk Union policy objectives, such as safety and public health, or may lead to the risk of re-identification of non-personal, anonymised data. Where such an act is adopted, the Commission shall lay down conditions applicable to the transfer to third-countries of such data by way of implementing acts. 

Those conditions shall be based on the nature of non-personal data categories identified in the specific Union act and on the grounds for deeming them highly sensitive, non-discriminatory and limited to what is necessary to achieve the public policy objectives identified in the Union law act, such as safety and public health, as well as risks of re-identification of anonymized data, in accordance with the Union’s international obligations. 

If specific Union acts under the first subparagraph require so, such conditions may include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements in this regard, limitations as regards the re-use of data in third-countries or categories of persons which are entitled to transfer such data to third countries or, in exceptional cases, restrictions as regards transfers to third-countries.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(3).

(12) The natural or legal person to which the right to re-use non-personal data was granted may transfer the data only to those third-countries for which the requirements in paragraphs 9 to 11 are met.

### Article 6 Fees

(1) Public sector bodies which allow re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) may charge fees for allowing the re-use of such data.

(2) Any fees shall be non-discriminatory, proportionate and objectively justified and shall not restrict competition.

(3) Public sector bodies shall ensure that any fees can be paid online through widely available cross-border payment services, without discrimination based on the place of establishment of the payment service provider, the place of issue of the payment instrument or the location of the payment account within the Union.

(4)  Where they apply fees, public sector bodies shall take measures to incentivise the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) for non-commercial purposes such as scientific research purposes and by small and medium-sized enterprises in line with State aid rules. This may include allowing re-use at lower or no fee.

(5)Fees shall be derived from the costs related to the processing of requests for re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1). Any fees shall be limited to the necessary costs incurred for the reproduction, provision and dissemination of data, rights’ clearance, costs for anonymisation or other forms or preparation of personal and confidential data as provided for in Article 5(3), costs for the maintenance of the secure processing environment, costs in relation to the acquisition of the right to permit re-use in accordance with this Chapter from third parties outside the public sector, as well as any costs in relation to supporting re-users in seeking consent of from data subjects and permission from data holders whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use.

(6) The criteria and methodology for calculating fees shall be laid down by the Member States and published in advance. The public sector body shall publish a description of the main categories of costs and the rules used for the allocation of costs.

### Article 7 Competent bodies

(1) For the tasks mentioned in this article, Member States shall designate one or more competent bodies, which may be sectoral, to support the public sector bodies which grant access to the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) in the exercise of that task. Member States may either establish one or more new competent bodies or rely on existing public sector bodies or on internal services of public sector bodies that fulfil the conditions set out by this Regulation.

(1a) The competent bodies may also be entrusted, pursuant to Union or national law which provides for such access to be given, to grant access for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1). While performing their function to grant or refuse access for re-use, Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8a shall apply in regard to such competent bodies.

(1b) The competent bodies shall have adequate legal, financial and technical resources to be able to comply with relevant Union or national law concerning the access regimes for the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1).

(2)The support provided for in paragraph 1 shall include, where necessary:

(a) providing technical support by making available a secure processing environment for providing access for the re-use of data;

(b)  providing technical support for ensuring data processing in a manner that preserves privacy and confidentiality of the information contained in the data for which re-use is allowed;

(c)  where relevant, assisting the public sector bodies to provide assistance to re-users in obtaining consent for re-use from data subjects or permission from data holders in line with their specific decisions, including on the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which the data processing is intended to take place;

(d)  providing public sector bodies with assistance on the adequacy of undertakings made by a re-user, pursuant to Article 5 (10).

(5) The Member States shall communicate to the Commission the identity of the competent bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 1 by [date of application of this Regulation]. They shall also communicate to the Commission any subsequent modification of the identity of those bodies.

### Article 8 Single information point

(1) Member States shall ensure that all relevant information concerning the application of Articles 5 and 6 is available through a single information point which may be linked to sectoral, regional or local information points. Functions of a single information point may be automated provided that adequate support by a public sector body is ensured. Member States may either establish a new information point or rely on an existing structure.

(2) The single information point shall be competent to receive enquiries or requests for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) and shall transmit them to the competent public sector bodies, or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1), where relevant, and where possible and appropriate, by automated means. The single information point shall make available by electronic means an asset list containing an overview of all available data resources, including, where relevant, those data resources available at sectoral, regional or local information points, with relevant information describing the available data. 

(3) Requests for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) shall be granted or refused by the competent public sector bodies or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1) within a reasonable time, and in any case within two months from the date of the request.

(4) Any natural or legal person affected by a decision of a public sector body or of a competent body, as the case may be, shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy against such decision before the courts of the Member State where the relevant body is located.

## Article 8a Processing of requests for re-use

(1) Unless shorter time limits have been established in accordance with national law, a decision on the requests for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) shall be adopted by the competent public sector bodies or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1) within two months from the dat of receipt of the request.

In case of exceptionally extensive and complex requests this period may be extended by no more than 30 days. In such cases the applicant shall be notified as soon as possible that more time is needed to process the request and the reasons why.

(2) Any natural or legal person directly affected by a decision of a public sector body or of a competent body adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 shall have an effective right of redress in the Member State where the relevant body is located. Such right of redress shall be laid down in national law and shall include the possibility of review by an impartial review body with the appropriate expertise, such as the national competition authority, the relevant access to documents authority, the supervisory authority established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or a national judicial authority, whose decisions are binding upon the public sector body concerned.
