## CHAPTER II RE-USE OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PROTECTED DATA HELD BY PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES

### Article 3 Categories of data

(1) This Chapter applies to data held by public sector bodies which are protected on grounds of:

(a) commercial confidentiality including business, professional and company secrets;

(b) statistical confidentiality;

(c) protection of intellectual property rights of third parties;

(d) protection of personal data.

(2) This Chapter does not apply to:

(a) data held by public undertakings;

(b) data held by public service broadcasters and their subsidiaries, and by other bodies or their subsidiaries for the fulfilment of a public service broadcasting remit;

(c) data held by cultural establishments and educational establishments;

(d)  data protected for reasons of national security , defence or public security;

(e)  data the supply of which is an activity falling outside the scope of the public task of the public sector bodies concerned as defined by law or by other binding rules in the Member State concerned, or, in the absence of such rules, as defined in accordance with common administrative practice in that Member State, provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review.

(3) The provisions of this Chapter do not create any obligation on public sector bodies to allow re-use of data nor do they release public sector bodies from their confidentiality obligations under Union or national law. This Chapter is without prejudice to Union and national law or international agreements to which the Union or Member States are parties on the protection of categories of data provided in paragraph 1. This Chapter is without prejudice to Union and national law on access to documents and to obligations of public sector bodies under Union and national law to allow the re-use of data.

### Article 4 Prohibition of exclusive arrangements

(1) Agreements or other practices pertaining to the re-use of data held by public sector bodies containing categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) which grant exclusive rights or which have as their object or effect to grant such exclusive rights or to restrict the availability of data for re-use by entities other than the parties to such agreements or other practices shall be prohibited.

(2) By way of derogation from paragraph 1, an exclusive right to re-use data referred to in that paragraph may be granted to the extent necessary for the provision of a service or a product in the general interest.

(3) Such exclusive right shall be granted in the context of a relevant service or concession contract in compliance with applicable Union and national public procurement and concession award rules, or, in the case of a contract of a value for which neither Union nor national public procurement and concession award rules are applicable, in compliance with the principles of transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.

(4) In all cases not covered by paragraph 3 and where the general interest purpose cannot be fulfilled without granting an exclusive right, the principles of transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality shall apply. (5) The period of exclusivity of the right to re-use data shall not exceed three years. Where a contract is concluded, the duration of the contract awarded shall be as aligned with the period of exclusivity.

(6) The award of an exclusive right pursuant to paragraphs (2) to (5), including the reasons why it is necessary to grant such a right, shall be transparent and be made publicly available online two months before entry into force, regardless of a possible publication of an award of a public procurement and concessions contract.

(7) Agreements or other practices falling within the scope of the prohibition in paragraph 1, which do not meet the conditions set out in paragraph 2, and which were concluded before the date of entry into force of this Regulation shall be terminated at the end of the contract and in any event at the latest within three years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.

(8) Where an exclusive right to re-use data does not meet the conditions set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, the exclusive right shall be void.

### Article 5 Conditions for re-use

(1) Public sector bodies which are competent under national law to grant or refuse access for the re-use of one or more of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) shall make publicly available the conditions for allowing such re-use. In that task, they may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1).

(2) Conditions for re-use shall be non-discriminatory, proportionate and objectively justified with regard to categories of data and purposes of re-use and the nature of the data for which re-use is allowed. These conditions shall not be used to restrict competition.

(3) Public sector bodies may impose a condition whereby reuse is subject to anonymization or pseudonymisatione of personal data, or deletion, modification or aggregation of commercially confidential information, including trade secrets.

(4) Public sector bodies may impose a condition

(a) to access and re-use the data remotely within a secure processing environment provided and controlled by the public sector; or

(b)  to access and re-use the data within the physical premises in which the secure processing environment is located, if remote access cannot be allowed without jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.

(5) The public sector bodies shall impose conditions that preserve the integrity of the functioning of the technical systems of the secure processing environment used. The public sector body shall reserve the right to verify the process, the means and any results of processing of data undertaken by the re-user to preserve the integrity of the protection of the data and reserve the right to prohibit the use of results that contain information jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.

(6) Where the re-use of data cannot be granted in accordance with the obligations laid down in paragraphs 3 to 5 and there is no other legal basis for transmitting the data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the public sector body shall support re-users in seeking consent of the data subjects and/or permission from the legal entities whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use, where it is feasible without disproportionate cost for the public sector. In that task they may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1).

(7) Re-use of data shall only be allowed in compliance with intellectual property rights. The right of the maker of a database as provided for in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC shall not be exercised by public sector bodies in order to prevent the re-use of data or to restrict re-use beyond the limits set by this Regulation.

(8) When data requested is considered confidential, in accordance with Union or national law, the public sector bodies shall ensure that the confidential information is not disclosed as a result of the re-use.

(9) The Commission may adopt implementing acts declaring that the legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements of a third country:

(a) ensure protection of intellectual property and trade secrets in a way that is essentially equivalent to the protection ensured under Union law;

(b) are being effectively applied and enforced; and

(c) provide effective judicial redress.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 29 (2).

(10) Public sector bodies shall only transmit non-personal data protected on grounds set out in Article 3 to a re-user which intends to transfer the data to a third country other than a country designated in accordance with paragraph 9 if the re-user undertakes:

(a) to comply with the obligations imposed in accordance with paragraphs 7 to 8 even after the data is transferred to the third country; and

(b)  to accept the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State of the public sector body as regards any dispute related to the compliance with the obligation in point a).

(11) Specific Union acts adopted in accordance with a legislative procedure may deeem certain non-personal data categories held by public sector bodies to be highly sensitive for the purposes of this Article, where their transfer to third coutries may put at risk Union policy objectives, such as safety and public health, or may lead to the risk of re-identification of anonymised data. The Commission shall lay down conditions applicable to the transfer to third-countries of such data by implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2). 

Those conditions shall be based on the nature of data categories identified in the Union act and on the grounds for deeming them highly sensitive, non-discriminatory and limited to what is necessary to achieve the public policy objectives identified in the Union law act, such as safety and public health, as well as risks of re-identification of anonymized data, in accordance with the Union’s international obligations. 

The conditions may include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements in this regard, limitations as regards the re-use of data in third-countries or categories of persons which are entitled to transfer such data to third countries or, in exceptional cases, restrictions as regards transfers to third-countries.

(12) The natural or legal person to which the right to re-use non-personal data was granted may transfer the data only to those third-countries for which the requirements in paragraphs 9 to 11 are met.

(13) Where the re-user intends to transfer non-personal data to a third country, the public sector body shall inform the data holder about the transfer of data to that third country.

### Article 6 Fees

(1) Public sector bodies which allow re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) may charge fees for allowing the re-use of such data.

(2) Any fees shall be non-discriminatory, proportionate and objectively justified and shall not restrict competition.

(3) Public sector bodies shall ensure that any fees can be paid online through widely available cross-border payment services, without discrimination based on the place of establishment of the payment service provider, the place of issue of the payment instrument or the location of the payment account within the Union.

(4)  Where they apply fees, public sector bodies shall take measures to incentivise the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) for non-commercial purposes and by small and medium-sized enterprises in line with State aid rules.

(5) Fees shall be derived from the costs related to the processing of requests for re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1). Any fees shall be limited to the necessary costs incurred for the reproduction, provision and dissemination of data, costs for anonymisation of personal data, costs for the maintenance of the secure processing environment, as well as any costs in relation to supporting re-users in seeking consent of data subjects. The criteria and methodology for calculating fees shall be laid down by the Member States and published in advance.

### Article 7 Competent bodies

(1) For the tasks mentioned in this Article Member States shall designate one or more competent bodies, which may be sectoral, to support the public sector bodies which grant access to the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) in the exercise of that task. Member States shall be allowed either to establish one or more new bodies or to rely on existing ones that fulfil the conditions set out by this Regulation.

(2)The support provided for in paragraph 1 shall include, where necessary:

(a) providing technical support by making available a secure processing environment for providing access for the re-use of data;

(b)  providing technical support in the application of tested techniques ensuring data processing in a manner that preserves privacy of the information contained in the data for which re-use is allowed, including techniques for pseudonymisation, anonymisation, generalisation, suppression and randomisation of personal data;

(c)  assisting the public sector bodies, where relevant, in obtaining consent or permission by re-users for re-use for altruistic and other purposes in line with specific decisions of data holders, including on the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which the data processing is intended to take place;

(d)  providing public sector bodies with assistance on the adequacy of undertakings made by a re-user, pursuant to Article 5 (10).

(3) The competent bodies may also be entrusted, pursuant Union or national law which provides for such access to be given, to grant access for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1). While performing their function to grant or refuse access for re-use, Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8 (3) shall apply in regard to such competent bodies.

(4) The competent body or bodies shall have adequate legal, financial and technical capacities and expertise to be able to comply with relevant Union or national law concerning the access regimes for the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1).

(5) The Member States shall communicate to the Commission the identity of the competent bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 1 by [date of application of this Regulation]. They shall also communicate to the Commission any subsequent modification of the identity of those bodies.

### Article 8 Single information point

(1) Member States shall ensure that all relevant information concerning the application of Articles 5 and 6 is available through a single information point. Functions of a single information point may be automated provided that adequate support by a public sector body is ensured. Member States shall be allowed either to establish a new information point or to rely on an existing structure.

(2) The single information point shall receive enquiries or requests for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) and shall transmit them to the competent public sector bodies, or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1), where relevant, and where possible and appropriate, by automated means. The single information point shall make available by electronic means a register of available data resources containing relevant information describing the nature of available data.

(3) Requests for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3 (1) shall be granted or refused by the competent public sector bodies or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7 (1) within within two months from the date of the request. In the case of exceptionally extensive and complex requests this period may be extended by 30 days. In such cases the applicant shall be notified as soon as possible that more time is needed to process the request and the reasons why.

(4) Any natural or legal person affected by a decision of a public sector body or of a competent body, as the case may be, shall have an effective right of redress in the Member State where the relevant body is located.
