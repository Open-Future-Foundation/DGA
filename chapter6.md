(ba) to advise and assist the Commission in developing consistent guidelines for the use of technologies to effectively prevent the identification of data subjects such as anonymisation, pseudonymisation, differential privacy, generalisation, or suppression and randomisation for the re-use of personal and non-personal data;

(bb) to advise and assist the Member States and the Commission on the harmonisation of the legal interpretation of anonymisation of data across the Union;

(bc) to advise and assist the Commission in developing consistent guidelines on how to best protect, in the context of this Regulation, commercially sensitive non-personal data, in particular trade secrets, but also non-personal data representing content protected by intellectual property rights from unlawful access that risks intellectual property theft or industrial espionage.

(c) to advise the Commission, in particular taking into account the input from standardisation organisations, on the prioritisation of crosssector standards to be used and developed for data use and cross-sector data sharing between emerging common European data spaces, cross-sectoral comparison and exchange of best practices with regards to sectoral requirements for security, access procedures, while taking into account sector-specific standardisations activities, and in particular in clarifying and distinguishing which standards and practices are cross-sectoral and which are sectoral. For this specific task a fixed configuration of the Board shall meet regularly.

(da) to propose guidelines for ‘common European data spaces’, meaning purpose- or sector-specific or cross-sectoral interoperable frameworks of common standards and practices to share or jointly process data for, inter alia, development of new products and services, scientific research or civil society initiatives. Such shared standards and practices shall take into account existing standards, comply with the competition rules and ensure non-discriminatory access for all participants, for the purpose of facilitating data sharing in the Union and reaping the potential of existing and future data spaces.

Those guidelines shall address, inter alia:

(i) cross-sectoral standards to be used and developed for data use and cross-sector data sharing, cross-sectoral comparison and exchange of best practices with regards to sectoral requirements for security, access procedures, while taking into account sector-specific standardisations activities, in particular in clarifying and distinguishing which standards and practices are cross-sectoral and which are sectoral;

(ii) requirements to counter barriers to market entry and to avoid lock-in effects, for the purpose of ensuring fair competition and interoperability;

(iii) adequate protection for legal data transfers outside the Union, including safeguards against any transfers prohibited by Union law;

(iv) adequate and non-discriminatory representation of relevant stakeholders in the governance of a common European data space;

(v) adherence to cybersecurity requirements in line with Union law.

(e) to facilitate the cooperation between national competent authorities, the Commission and other Union and international bodies under this Regulation through capacity-building and the exchange of information, in particular by establishing methods for the efficient exchange of information relating to the notification procedure for providers of data intermediation services and the registration and monitoring of recognised data altruism organisations.

(ea) to facilitate cooperation between Member States in relation to the rules on penalties laid down by the Member States pursuant to Article 31 and to issue recommendations as regards the harmonisation of those penalties across the Union, as well as advise the Commission on the need to amend this Regulation with a view to further harmonisation of the rules on penalties referred to in Article 31.lties laid down by the Member States pursuant to Article 31 and to issue recommendations as regards the harmonisation of those penalties across the Union.
