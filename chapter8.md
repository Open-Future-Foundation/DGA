## CHAPTER VIII FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article 30 International access and transfer 

(1) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the data intermediation service provider or the entity entered in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations, as the case may be, shall take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures, including contractual arrangements, in order to prevent international transfer or governmental access to non- personal data held in the Union where such transfer or governmental access would create a conflict with Union law or national law of the relevant Member State, without prejudice to paragraph 2 or 3.

(2) Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a data intermediation service provider or entity entered in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations to transfer from or give access to non- personal data within the scope of this Regulation in the Union may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or any such agreement between the requesting third country and a Member State.

(3) In the absence of such an international agreement, where a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a data intermediation service provider or entity entered in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations is the addressee of a decision of a court or of an administrative authority of a third country to transfer from or give access to non-personal data within the scope of this Regulation held in the Union and compliance with such a decision would risk putting the addressee in conflict with Union law or with national law of the relevant Member State, transfer to or access to such data by that third-country authority shall take place only:

(a) where the third-country system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, and it requires the court order or the decision, as the case may be, to be specific in character, for instance by establishing a sufficient link to certain suspected persons, or infringements;

(b) the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third-country; and

(c) the competent court issuing the order or reviewing the decision of an administrative authority is empowered under the law of that third country to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of the data protected by Union law or national law of the relevant Member State.

(4) If the conditions in paragraph 2, or 3 are met, the public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the data intermediation service provider or the entity entered in a national register of recognised data altruism organisations, as the case may be, shall, provide the minimum amount of data permissible in response to a request, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

(5) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the intermediation service provider and the entity entered in a national register of recognized data altruism organizations shall inform the data subject or the data holder about the existence of a request of an administrative authority in a third-country to access its data, except in cases where the request serves law enforcement purposes and for as long as this is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of the law enforcement activity.
