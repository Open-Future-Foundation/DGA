## CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article 1 Subject matter and scope

(1) This Regulation lays down:

(a) conditions for the re-use, within the Union, of certain categories of data held by public sector bodies;

Where a sector-specific Union legal act requires public sector bodies, providers of data sharing services or registered entities providing data altruism services to comply with specific additional technical, administrative or organisational requirements, including through an authorisation or certification regime, those provisions of that sector-specific Union legal act shall also apply.

This Regulation is without prejudice to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2002/58/EC, including the powers of supervisory authorities. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Regulation and Union law on the protection of personal data, the latter prevails.
