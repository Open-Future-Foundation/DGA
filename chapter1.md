## CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article 1 Subject matter and scope

(1) This Regulation lays down:

(a) conditions for the re-use, within the Union, of certain categories of data held by public sector bodies;

(b) a notification and supervisory framework for the provision of data intermediation services;

(c) a framework for voluntary registration of entities which collect and process data made available for altruistic purposes.

(2) This Regulation does not create any obligation on public sector bodies to allow re-use of data nor does it release public sector bodies from their confidentiality obligations under Union or national law. This Regulation is without prejudice to specific provisions in Union or national law regarding access to or re-use of certain categories of data, in particular regarding granting of access to and disclosure of official documents. This Regulation is also without prejudice to obligations of public sector bodies under Union and national law to allow the re-use of data or to requirements related to processing of non-personal data. Where a sector-specific Union legal act or national law requires public sector bodies, providers of data intermediation services or registered entities providing data altruism services to comply with specific additional technical, administrative or organisational requirements, including through an authorisation or certification regime, those provisions of that sector-specific Union legal act or national law shall also apply. Any additional requirements shall be non-discriminatory, proportionate and objectively justified.

(3) Union and national law on the protection of personal data shall apply to any personal data processed in connection with this Regulation. In particular, this Regulation shall be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC, including the powers and competences of supervisory authorities. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Regulation and Union or national law on the protection of personal data, Union or national law prevails. This Regulation does not create a legal basis for the processing of personal data and does not alter any obligations and rights set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Directive 2002/58/EC.

(4) This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences of the Member States regarding activities concerning public security, defence and national security.
