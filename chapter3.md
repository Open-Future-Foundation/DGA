## CHAPTER III REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO DATA SHARING SERVICES

### Article 9 Providers of data sharing services

(1) The provision of the following data intermediation services shall be subject to a notification procedure:

(a) intermediation services between data holders and potential data users of non-personal data, including making available the technical or other means to enable such services; those services may include bilateral or multilateral exchanges of non-personal data or the creation of platforms or databases enabling the exchange or joint exploitation of non-personal data, as well as the establishment of a specific infrastructure for the interconnection of data holders and data users;

(b) intermediation services between data subjects that seek to make their personal data available and potential data users, including making available the technical or other means to enable such services, and in particular enabling the exercise of the data subjects' rights provided in Regulation (EU) 2016/679; the data sharing services shall not themselves process the personal data, but shall only allow data subjects to give consent to specific data users and for specific purposes;

(c) activities of data cooperatives, that is to say organisations or services, which: 

(i) support members who are data subjects to exercise the rights provided in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by offering services including, but not limited to, collectively negotiating terms and conditions for data processing, and allowing for mechanisms to exchange views on data processing purposes and conditions, thereby representing their interests; this may be paired with making available data storage services to members; or

(ii) enable small and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit or academic institutions who are members of the cooperative or who confer the power to the cooperative to collectively negotiate terms for sharing non-personal data.

(2) This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of other Union and national law to providers of data intermediation services, including powers of supervisory authorities to ensure compliance with applicable law, in particular as regard the protection of personal data and competition law.

### Article 10 Notification of data intermediation services

(1) Any provider of data intermediation services who intends to provide the services referred to in Article 9 (1) shall submit a notification to the competent authority referred to in Article 12.

The representative shall be mandated by the provider of data intermediation services to be addressed in addition to or instead of it by, in particular, competent authorities and data subjects and data holders on all issues related to the data intermediation services for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation.

(4) A provider of data intermediation services shall not start the activity before any measures required under applicable law have been taken, in particular completing a data protection impact assessment and consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Without prejudice to any such obligations, the provider of data intermediation services may start the activity subject to the conditions laid down in this Chapter upon notification of the competent authority.

(fb) an indication in the case of processing of personal data or where the provider can reasonably assume that the combination of non-personal data under the service it provides could lead to the identification or identifiability of natural persons;

(g) the intended date for starting the activity, and, where applicable, the duration foreseen;

(7) At the request of the provider, the competent authority shall, within two weeks, issue a standardised declaration, confirming that the provider has submitted the notification referred to in paragraph 4.
