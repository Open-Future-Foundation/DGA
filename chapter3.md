(c) activities of data cooperatives, that is to say organisations or services, which: 

(i) support members who are data subjects to exercise the rights provided in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by offering services including, but not limited to, collectively negotiating terms and conditions for data processing, allowing for mechanisms to exchange views on data processing purposes and conditions, thereby representing their interests; or 

(ii) enable small and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit or academic institutions to collectively negotiate terms for sharing non-personal data.

(2) This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of other Union and national law to providers of data sharing services, including powers of supervisory authorities to ensure compliance with applicable law, in particular as regard the protection of personal data and competition law.
